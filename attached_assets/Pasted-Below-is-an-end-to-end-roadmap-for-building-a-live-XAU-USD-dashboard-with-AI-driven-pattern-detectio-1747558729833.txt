Below is an end-to-end roadmap for building a live XAU/USD dashboard with AI-driven pattern detection and Telegram alerts in Python. You’ll learn which components to pick, how they fit together, and where to find beginner-friendly tutorials so you can get up and running—even without prior coding experience.

1. Architecture Overview
You’ll build four main layers:

Data Acquisition: Pull live XAU/USD quotes via a broker or financial-data API.

Analysis & AI: Compute indicators (MA, RSI, Bollinger Bands), support/resistance, and run ML/pattern-recognition models.

Visualization & UI: Render interactive charts in a web app.

Alerts Delivery: Push trade signals to Telegram via a bot.

Once glued together in a Python framework, you get an automated, AI-powered trading dashboard that streams live gold-price data, highlights key patterns, and pings you on Telegram with buy/sell signals.

2. Data Acquisition
Use a Forex-focused REST API to fetch live XAU/USD ticks in Python.

TraderMade API: Free trial and paid plans; returns JSON of real-time quotes with Pandas integration 
TraderMade
.

Yahoo Finance (via yfinance): Works for many forex pairs but may not reliably support XAU/USD 
Stack Overflow
.

Alternative: Broker SDKs (e.g. OANDA, IG) offering streaming endpoints.

Key steps:

Sign up and get an API key.

Use requests or dedicated SDK to pull quotes every second or minute.

Store in a rolling Pandas DataFrame.

3. Technical Indicators & Support/Resistance
3.1 Indicators with TA-Lib
TA-Lib offers 200+ built-in indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ADX, etc.) and candlestick-pattern recognition 
TA-Lib
.

python
Copy
Edit
import talib  
sma = talib.SMA(df['close'], timeperiod=20)  
rsi = talib.RSI(df['close'], timeperiod=14)  
3.2 Real-Time Indicator Updates
realtime_talib: Lightweight wrapper to update indicators on streaming data using asyncio 
GitHub
.

3.3 Support & Resistance Levels
Pivot Points: Compute central pivot (P), supports (S1,S2), resistances (R1,R2) from prior high/low/close 
Investopedia
.

Fractal Methods: Identify local swing high/lows via scipy.signal.argrelextrema and draw horizontal lines 
Medium
.

4. Chart Patterns & AI Recognition
4.1 Rule-Based Libraries
PatternPy: High-speed recognition of Head & Shoulders, Double Top/Bottom, Flags, etc., built on Pandas/NumPy 
GitHub
.

Custom Scripts: Slide window over peaks/troughs to detect patterns in pure Python (see Alpaca tutorial) 
Alpaca
.

4.2 Deep Learning Approaches
ChartScanAI: YOLOv8-based pattern detection for real-time chart images; more complex but highly accurate 
GitHub
.

YOLOv8: Fine-tune on annotated candlestick images of patterns.

5. Visualization & Dashboard
5.1 Plotly / Dash
Streaming Traces: plotly.graph_objects with extend_traces for live updates 
Data Apps for Production | Plotly
.

Dash: Build components (graphs, dropdowns) and callbacks to refresh every tick.

5.2 Streamlit
Rapid Prototyping: Use st.line_chart or st.plotly_chart for interactive dashboards; auto-refresh via st.experimental_rerun() 
Streamlit
.

6. Generating Trading Signals
Define your entry/exit logic by combining indicators and pattern triggers:

Bullish Signal: Price > 20-period SMA and RSI < 30 and double bottom detected.

Bearish Signal: Price < 50-period EMA and head-and-shoulders formed.

Run this logic continuously on incoming data and push signals when conditions change.

7. Telegram Integration
7.1 Bot Setup
Talk to @BotFather on Telegram to create a bot and get your API token 
Telegram APIs
.

Install python-telegram-bot:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade
python-telegram-bot

7.2 Sending Messages
python
Copy
Edit
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler

updater = Updater("YOUR_TOKEN")
def signal(ctx, update):
    update.message.reply_text("BUY XAUUSD @ 1980")
updater.dispatcher.add_handler(CommandHandler("signal", signal))
updater.start_polling()
You can also push proactively via bot.send_message(chat_id=…, text=…) when your signal logic fires 
Python Telegram Bot
